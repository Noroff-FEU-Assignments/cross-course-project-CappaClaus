    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would suggest multiple ways to secure your website and I would advise to get as many security protocols as possible as there are many users with malicious intent. I would rank the top solutions that are most common which are:  
      <br>
      <br>Using Sanitization of data which in other words means that the data the system accepts is in the right format. Can be done manually or using other third-party solutions (like NodeJS). 
      <br>  
      <br>Secure authorization and authentication which makes, as the names suggest, Secure authorization and authentication hard to crack. Could be done manually or preferred using an authorization protocol like one-login etc. 
      <br>  
        
      <br>Take advantage of well-known third-party application which are trusted. Looking at download per week/month is a good indication and doing research. 
      <br>  
        
      <br>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production. It basically watches for slight mistakes from developers and maintain reliability coming as more gets added or removed, and should be used regularly as to not letting any mistakes/bugs develop into something in which can be taken advantage off. 
      <br>
      <br>Network security to protect the information coming in and out from your website (data packets) config web server using https and http strict transport security. 
      <br>
      <br>Implementation of automatic user timeout which times out users after X amount of time have passed with inactivity. 
      <br>
      <br>encourage strong passwords. 
      <br> 
      <br>Keep everything/programs up to date.
      <br>  
      <br>find out of the most popular threats and address their vulnerabilities first. OWASP got a great list to go out from.</p>
